## 📊 Project Overview

The Ames Housing dataset provides detailed information on 2,930 residential property sales in Ames, Iowa, with 81 features describing each home. The goal of this project was to explore the data, uncover key insights, and demonstrate a full data analysis workflow, including:

- Data summary and exploration plan
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Key findings and actionable insights
- Hypothesis formulation and statistical testing
- Conclusions and next steps

## 🏆 Key Results

- Identified Gr Liv Area, Overall Qual, and Neighborhood as the strongest predictors of SalePrice.
- Demonstrated the impact of outliers and missing values on modeling.
- Confirmed, via statistical testing, that neighborhood significantly affects home prices.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy)
- Jupyter Notebook
- missingno (for missing data visualization)

## 📚 Course Context

This project was completed for the [Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-exploratory-data-analysis-for-machine-learning) course by IBM on Coursera as a capstone assignment, demonstrating skills in data wrangling, EDA, feature engineering, and statistical analysis.
